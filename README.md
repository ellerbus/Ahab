# Ahab

Captain Ahab is a fictional character in Herman Melville's
Moby-Dick (1851), the monomaniacal captain of the whaling
ship Pequod. On a previous voyage, the white whale Moby
Dick bit off Ahab's leg, leaving him with a prosthesis
made out of whalebone. The whaling voyage of the Pequod
ends up as a hunt for revenge on the whale, as Ahab impels
the crew-members to support his fanatical mission. When
Moby Dick is finally sighted, Ahab's hate robs him of
all caution, and the whale drags Ahab to the bottom of the sea.
